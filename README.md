# LangApp
I'm learning French and I thought it would be nice to build a website to facilitate learning while I also simultaneously hone my Rails' skill set. The main purpose of this site is to build and take quizzes through submitted questions.

Link to project (site may be offline):
[ LangApp ](lang-app.fly.dev)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, Ruby on Rails, StimulusJS

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.
