# LangApp
I'm learning French and I thought it would be nice to build a website to facilitate learning while I also simultaneously hone my Rails' skill set. The main purpose of this site is to build and take quizzes through submitted questions.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Ruby on Rails, Tailwind CSS, StimulusJS

I've been learning Ruby on Rails through [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com). One of the recent lessons introduced [_StimulusJS_](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/), "A modest Javascript framework", which has been a cool tool to add some interactivity to my pages.

I also incorporated Tailwind CSS as it seems to have gotten good reviews in the industry and is easy to include in my Rails projects.
